## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- build (for building packages)
- twine (for uploading to PyPI)

### Environment Variables
For publishing scripts, you need to set these environment variables:

```bash
# For TestPyPI
export TESTPYPI_API_TOKEN=your_testpypi_token_here

# For PyPI
export PYPI_API_TOKEN=your_pypi_token_here
```

## Usage Examples

### Complete Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# 2. Run tests
./scripts/test.sh

# 3. Build package
./scripts/build.sh

# 4. Update version (if needed)
./scripts/version.sh 1.0.2

# 5. Test on TestPyPI
export TESTPYPI_API_TOKEN=your_token
./scripts/publish-testpypi.sh

# 6. Publish to PyPI
export PYPI_API_TOKEN=your_token
./scripts/publish-pypi.sh
```

### Quick Testing

```bash
# Run all tests and checks
./scripts/test.sh

# Build package
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Version Management

```bash
# Update to version 1.0.2
./scripts/version.sh 1.0.2

# Update to version 2.0.0
./scripts/version.sh 2.0.0
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

The scripts are designed to work with the GitHub Actions workflows:

- **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs on pull requests and pushes
- **Publish Workflow** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`): Runs on releases

The GitHub Actions use the same commands as these scripts, ensuring consistency between local development and CI/CD.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Make sure scripts are executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. **Python Not Found**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and in PATH

3. **Missing Dependencies**: Run the setup script
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```

4. **Token Issues**: Ensure API tokens are set correctly
   ```bash
   echo $PYPI_API_TOKEN
   echo $TESTPYPI_API_TOKEN
   ```
